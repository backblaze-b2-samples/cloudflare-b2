# If you set ALLOWED_HEADERS, it is your responsibility to ensure that the
# list of headers that you specify supports the functionality that your client
# apps use, for example, "range". The list below is a suggested starting point.

# Note that HTTP headers are not case-sensitive. "host" will match "host",
# "Host" and "HOST".
